# Some Background
I was born to Chinese immigrant parents in Miami, raised in Brooklyn, and received my Bachelors of Science at Columbia University in 2021. Now I work at Microsoft in Seattle, where I enjoy hiking, exploring the local food and music scene, and taking photos!

I was always fascinated by the intracacies of science and technology and inspired by their potential impact. I was actually originally a Biomedical Engineering major, but that changed once I discovered Computer Science. Since my first programming class freshman year of college, I&apos;ve always enjoyed the process of immersing myself under the hood of a complex software system. For example, I loved exploring and expanding my knowledge of distributed systems, fullstack engineering, and machine learning. I'm passionate about learning and strive to grow my engineering ability in order to develop more powerful and impactful software solutions!

# Some Facts
- At 13, I achieved the highest grade at ARBSM (a music examination board) for piano and saxophone. I was consistently in band/orchestra throughout all of my schooling and I play piano to this day.
- At 16, I became second author to a chemistry research publication (<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/cp/c6cp01443g#!divAbstract" target="_blank">Link</a>). I was itching to jump into the world of science so I cold-emailed professors at local colleges, asking if they needed any more assistants. Dr. Ming Tang accepted my offer and after a summer of learning and NMR spetra data analysis, the paper was completed.
- At 19, I spent a summer abroad in Paris, studying art history and music history. I had always loved music but this is when I discovered the world of fine art.
- In college, I was a part of the Columbia Bartending Agency, Biomedical Engineering Society, Pops Orchestra, and more.
- I have a FujiFilm x100v and a Canon EOS Rebel SL2. I'm still working on a photography section for this website, so for now you can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kmao.jpg/" target="_blank">instagram</a>!
